# Diabetes Prediction Project

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting diabetes based on demographic and clinical data. The project leverages various machine learning models and techniques to develop an accurate predictive model.

## Project Overview

Diabetes is a prevalent health issue worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective management. This project aims to build a prediction model using machine learning algorithms to identify individuals at risk of diabetes based on demographic and clinical factors.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains demographic and clinical features, including age, gender, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, hypertension, heart disease, and smoking history. The target variable is binary, indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

**Dataset Source**: [Kaggle Diabetes Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset)

## Contents

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks (`project.ipynb`) containing the project code and analysis.
- **Data**: CSV file (`diabetes_data.csv`) containing the dataset used for training and testing.
- **Report**: Project report (`project_report.pdf`) summarizing the project objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.
- **README.md**: This file providing an overview of the project and repository contents.
